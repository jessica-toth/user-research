## See individual transactions
Transactions are the atomic lifeblood of your financial health. They are your everyday purchases, showing you how you've chosen to spend your money, where, and when. 

- All transactions are shown by default. While two sets of filters can be used to approach and understand your transactions, consider the ones on the right to be more comprehensive. Use the ones on top and on the right in combination with eachother to acheive your desired goal (the transactions you wish to see). 
- The one distinct filter option is the "Edit multiple" button. This option allows you to take action on multiple transactions at once. 
- Use the Summary on the bottom right to get a quick, point-in-time perspective of your filtered transactions: 
  - Total transactions
  - Largest transaction
  - Largest expense ....

## Get to know your cash flow
If transactions are the atoms, Cash Flow categories and groups are the molecules in understanding your finances. Cashflow is the easiest way to understand how you are spending your money. 

- Use the Cashflow bar chart to get a clear picture of how Income and Expenses compare each month. 
  - Nuance is important here. If you're tracking Savings as part of your Expenses, then zeroing out each month is OK. In a month where Expenses are greater than Income, that's an area to explore. Go back to your Transactions for that month and see if data are mislabeled. 

![Cashflow bar chart](https://github.com/jessica-toth/user-research/blob/main/Cashflow1.png)

- The Expensees horizontal barchart is key to understanding your hightest expenses. By default your expenses are set to a Monthly and Category view.
  - Use the buttons on top of the Cash Flow page to change your timing view (monthly, quarterly, yearly) or buckets (categories, groups, merchants).
  - Use the filters to funnel down to specific accounts or tags.
  - Consider sharing your information and use the this functionality to alter amounts to percentages.

## Run reports
Reports offer you a way to drill into spending in various ways. How you spend your money is what you prioritize. Use reports to better understand your priorities. The most useful reports offered are: Spending, Income, and Sankey.

### Become familiar with spending
The focus of Spending reports is on communicating the areas in which you are spending. 
- Use the top drop-down to decide which view to focus on: Category, Group, or Merchant
- Use additional features at the top of the Reports page to alter the graph type, filter accounts, change the timing, and many other elements.

### Be conscious of your income
Hopefully you know how much you are making each month. But are you aware of the net amount amount and are there other sources of income you're not considering? As well, is Monarch counting all of your income accurately. Use this function as a check, a confirmation on your assumptions.

### Watch your money flow
The Sankey report is the coolest, most intuitive way to understand how your money is being spent. The greater the spending area (Group or Category) in terms of dollars, the larger the area on the screen.
- Start with Groups to more easily see your expenditures. Note these are not stacked top to bottom (greater to least). 
- Choose Both to understand how Groups breaks down into smaller units of Categorial units.

## Architect your budget
Budgetting can be a controversial topic. But in case you **are** into them, Monarch offers you features to both budget and forecast.
- In the Budget tab, you are offered two ways to think about this money management strategy: Income + Expenses. 
  - In the Income section, think of "Budgeting" your income as simply noting your income -- what you expect it to be for the upcoming month.
  - Scroll to the Expenses section, where you'll see Categories are collapsed into Groups. Open each Group and decide per Category (Charity, Gifts, Mortgage, etc.) is there an amount you expect to spend each month?

Beyond developing a budget you may also be interested in Forecasting into the future. Think of this feature as the Budgetting feature with a planning flare.
- Click into each Category and decide (assume) how much you will be spending not only this month but each month for the rest of the calendar year.
- Scroll to the bottom to see how much money is remaining per month.

## Keep an eye on recurring expenses
How easy is it to sign-up for $2 of extra storage or a $10 streaming service? All of those subcriptions add up and after awhile can be hard to track. Use the Recurring page of Monarch to get a sense of the subscriptions you have at a monthly snapshot and when those payments occur. 
- Click into any of the subscriptions to see how this month's payment compares to past payments. Sometimes charges go up quietly over time. This is a useful feature to catch those small changes.

## See individual transactions
Transactions are the atomic lifeblood of your financial health. They are your everyday purchases, showing you how you've chosen to spend your money, where, and when. 

- All transactions are shown by default. While two sets of filters can be used to approach and understand your transactions, consider the ones on the right to be more comprehensive. Use the ones on top and on the right in combination with eachother to acheive your desired goal (the transactions you wish to see). 
- The one distinct filter option is the "Edit multiple" button. This option allows you to take action on multiple transactions at once. 
- Use the Summary on the bottom right to get a quick, point-in-time perspective of your filtered transactions: 
  - Total transactions
  - Largest transaction
  - Largest expense ....

## Get to know your cash flow
If transactions are the atoms, cashflow are the molecules in understanding your finances. Cashflow is the easiest way to understand how you are spending your money. 

- Use the Cashflow bar chart to get a clear picture of how Income and Expenses compare each month. 
  - Nuance is important here. If you're tracking Savings as part of your Expenses, then zeroing out each month is OK. In a month where Expenses are greater than Income, that's an area to explore. Go back to your Transactions for that month and see if data are mislabeled. 

- The Expensees horizontal barchart is key to understanding your hightest expenses. 
  - By default your expenses are set to a Monthly and Category view. .
